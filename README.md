Advent of Code 2023 is here!

I'm doing it in Haskell - again.  I should try branching out.

I'll be posting my updates daily.

If you want to build my solutions, I'm using ghc version 9.6.1.  

Modify the `import` statement on line 7 of `app/Main.hs` to compile and run for a given day.

Use `cabal build` to build, and `cabal run` to run.
